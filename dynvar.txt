// This is a little trick Mumfrey taught me.
&var = &%&array1[0]%[0];
// Use two sets of '%' around the variable so that it works properly.
// This is done because the previous variable has the name of the variable,
// so you have to execute the variable twice to get the value of the dynamic variable.
LOG(Example1: %%&var%%);

//I'll give an easier example here;

// This var contains the name of the third variable.
&var1 = "var3";

// This is the dynamic double variable that contains the variable as a string.
&var2 = &%&var1%;

// This is the content of the third variable.
&var3 = "&2Rawr!"

// Here you turn &var2 in a string, which is "&var3"
// Now a second pair of '%' around it so that "&var3" becomes "&2rawr"
LOG(Example2: %%&var2%%);
